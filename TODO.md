# To Do

#### Work Tracker
- ~~Count time for each task to display in the table~~
- ~~Update table hours per each task dynamically~~
- ~~Highlight the row when running a task~~
- ~~Change the way we measure activity~~
    - ~~set it to 100% activity so long as time since any key was pressed is lower
than the activity poll window~~
- ~~Flush when switching between tasks~~
- Separate UI ticks from activity ticks
- Organize UI code in a better way, currently a mess, especially button handling.

#### Reporting
- ~~Add an HTML report.~~
    - ~~HTML report is saved to file and then opened right away with chrome browser.~~
    - ~~Should be able to generate reports for 1-360 days.~~
    - ~~It should still look nice for both weekly, quarterly and yearly reports.~~
    - ~~Should contain bar charts~~
        - ~~Time by task~~
        - ~~Time*activity~~
    - ~~Move report code to it's separate package~~
    - ~~Send an email option~~
    - ~~Make sure that large reports like yearly and quarterly also look bearable~~
